  ## Description
  Four Pawâ€™s Best Buddies is an social media application that allows users to view the dogs that come to our daycare/boarding/grooming facility. The user is able to create an account with their email/password or log in with Google. From there, they will be able to create posts about their dogs and their experiences at Four Paw B&B, like other posts that other people have created, update their posts, delete their posts, and search for dogs by the dog's name. I created a simple and fun mobile responsive interface that anybody of any age could use and enjoy.

  ## Usage
  To create your own social media app, first you must copy and paste your own MongoDB database link in the **config/dev.js** file. Then, open your terminal in the root directory and run:
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  Then open a second terminal in the root directory and run:
  ```
  cd client
  ```
  and then:
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  After you have all of the necessary dependencies installed, you should be ready to go! Still in the root directory of the first terminal, run:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  In the second terminal you should still be in the client folder. Please run:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
