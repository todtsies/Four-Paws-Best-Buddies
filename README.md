  ## Description
  Four Pawâ€™s Best Buddies is an social media application that allows users to view the dogs that come to Four Paw Bed & Biscuit. The user is able to create an account with their email/password or login with Google. From there, they will be able to create posts about their dogs and their experiences at Four Paw B&B, like other posts that other people have created, update their posts, delete their posts, and search for dogs by their name. I made an easy to maneuver interface that anybody of any age could use and enjoy. I want our clients to know we care care about their dogs just as much as they do!
